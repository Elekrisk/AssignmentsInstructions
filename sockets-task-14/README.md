# DD1338 Week 14

We hope you have had a great time with your holidays, and your code has been blessed! This week you will be presenting your games, and we will also be moving on to a new subject!

## The Internet is for... Fun!

### Sockets!

This weeks task is to work with sockets! To do this, you will have to select a programming language of your choice and figure out how sockets work in that language. Most languages, like Java, have built in Objects for sockets that are really easy to work with. To get you started, you can read [this guide](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/) on Python sockets. The guide also shares its source code [here](https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/python-sockets-tutorial).

### Prepare your assignment

1. Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-task-14` (Haskellers: You already have your repos in `inda-20`).
2. Clone your repository to your machine.
3. Select a language to work with.
4. Learn how to use sockets in that language.
5. Start working on your preffered assignment

## Assignments

This week you can select between two plus-assignments or the regular assignment!

### 1. Make a Chat client/server!

The main point of this week is to make a Server and Client that can communicate with each other using sockets. For this assignment, we want your server to support multiple clients, meaning that two (bonus assignment: or more) clients can connect and communicate with each other trough the server.

### 2. Improve your game(s)!

If you want to you could add some form of multiplayer functionality to your games from last week. This could be to allow Player Vs Player, or you could do that as well as adding an ingame chat while playing multiplayer. This option allows you to work alone or continue working with your partner from `task-12/13`

### 3. Regular task

As always, if you don't want to do the plus assignments that we hand out, you can always do the regular Java assignments!
