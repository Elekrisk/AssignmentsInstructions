# DD1337 Week 8

## Getting started with MIPS

### Install MARS

1) Install Java, if you havn't done it already. Make sure that you have at least **Java 9**. 
2) [Download MARS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/MARS_4_5_Aug2014/Mars4_5.jar) as a `.jar` file. This is the same application as you will use during *IS1500 Datorteknik och komponenter* next year.
3) Open MARS by running the `.jar` file, i.e. double click it.

### Prepare for your assigment

1) Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-task-8`.
2) Clone your newly created repository.

## Assignments

This week you're going to complete two subassignments. The first assignment is to translate a program written in C to MIPS assembly, and the second one is to write a specified application in MIPS assembly.

See `./hello-world` and `./input-output` for MIPS code examples.

### Higher level => Lower level

> Note: If you choose to do the optional assignment below, you do not need to turn in multiplication separately, however, doing multiplication can help you figuring out faculty!

Learn what it means to be a compiler by translating C to MIPS assembly instructions. Your task is to write a file `./high-to-low/multiplication.asm`, which contains the same algorithm and logic as in `./high-to-low/multiplication.c`. To clarify: you may only use the `add` instruction, not `mul` (or similar)!

*(optional)* Write an application which, with the same multiplication logic as in `multipication.asm`, calculates a given faculty. 

### [Inbyggda System-mastern](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/program/TEBSM/20212/arskurs1), h√§r kommer jag!

Show that no one can write single-chip logic as royally as you do! Write an application, which takes one integer as input and prints all prime numbers up to that integer. The prime number search algoritm must be an implementation of [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). 

Place your solution file(s) inside the `./sieve` directory.

For help with code setup, begin by copying the contents of `./template.asm` into your main `.asm` file.

### Questions

#### 

Observe the following code:

```assembly
# LISTDEFINITION
```

Know the answer of the following question:
- Why do array declarations in fast languages, like Rust and C, require the given length to be of constant value?



```
    move    $s7, $ra        # save return address

    ### CODE ###

    move    $ra, $s7        # restore $ra (not needed here)
    jr      $ra             # return to where main was called from
```
