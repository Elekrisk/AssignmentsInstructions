# DD1338 Task 12

This week we finaly get to a task that many of you have been looking forward to. It is time to create a game!

### Getting into groups

For this assignment we want you to pair up two-and-two. If you can not find anyone to work with, you can do this assignment alone, however, this task is designed so that you pair up for a reason (and learning to work in pairs is an important part of being a developer!)

### Repos

Since repos under `inda-20` are individual, we recommend that all groups have a shared repo in `INDAPlus20` (Yes, that means you too @Haskellers, not just the silly Rust group this time!)

## Game Requirements

The game you are about to create has but two requirements!

1)
    The game must be a 1v1 game (you could have more players if you _reallllllllly_ want to). Meaning the player or an AI goes head to head with another player or AI. Other than that, be creative!
2)
    The next INDA-task will be to create a game where your objective is to create an AI that you can play against (or pit two AI's against each other!). Therefore it is important that you create your game in such a way that you _can_ create an AI for it!

The game itself can be anything that you want it to be, make something fun or creative, but remember that even something like Pong is good enough for a pass as long as you follow our requirements!

> There is no requirement on graphics. As long as we can _see_ the game it should be fine.

### Prepare Assignment

1) Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-<KTH_ID2>-game` under the `INDAPlus20` organisation and clone it.
2) Navigate into your newly created repository and start writing.
    - Make a fun game!

No example this week! (sorry)

Oh wait. We dont have example code, but the ++ TA Richard has a similar game you can look at [here!](https://rick.ee/sidor/vertiball.html)

### Questions

No questions either? huh.

### Grading

Grading is a bit special this week. To make sure that we CAN grade it. Include in a `README.md` file how to build/run your game. Other than that, we want a functional game that means the requirements specified under [Game Requirements](Game-Requirements)
