# DD1338 Week 17

## Dynamic Programming (mostly)! 

You think you're a good programmer eh? Well think again! If you havn't tried Dyn-Prog before, you are this week going to experience the pain of optimising a problem to make it go from having a runtime of a few hours, down to under a second.

### Prepare for your assigment

1) Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-task-17` (or not).
2) Clone your newly created repository and start coding. 

To make your Kattis-experience easier, see `./Kattis_template/src/main.rs`. If you're mot all fÃ¶rmodan using Java, make use of [this utility class](https://open.Kattis.com/download/Kattio.java?1a0093=) to simplify input-output fast enough to satisfy the judge.

## Assignment
This week, like some other weeks, you may choose between two different assignments:

- Solve LAB2 from DD2350
- (Easier) Solve an ADK problem + some other Kattis assignments

The idea is that you will work with dynamic programming this week no matter which assignment you choose. Of course, you can also do the regular Java assignment.

### ADK Lab 2
Going to [THIS LINK!](https://kth.instructure.com/courses/21037/assignments/124042) you will have access to preparatory questions for the lab. On the same page you will find "Labblydelsen" which is where you want to head to find the instructions for the lab istself.

> This lab can be quite difficult to do as there is some material that will be missing for you. However, we have tested that you can access the canvas page for the assignment, so it could be possible for you to go to the main page of the canvas course and find a page called "Recorded lectures". We also have no way of providing the (naive) example code but if you can ssh into the school computers you should be able to find it yourself.

You will also find the link to the Kattis problem that you need to pass for this assignment. We have provided you with test cases and a big input file to test locally. This is the same input format as Kattis!

>IMPORTANT. If testing with the big file then head to the end, after #, and replace the letters with full words to get better results!

I really recommend solving this, as it is a really fun assignment and it will help you in a few years :)

### Multiple problems.

If the above ADK problem is too difficult. We have provided you an alternative!

- Solve 3 (4? VIolAAA!!!!) of the provided problems with
    - at least one problem from `./Assignment.pdf`
    - at least one Kattis problem. (LINK!!!!)

The first problem from the PDF is recommended, as it should be the easiest one. (And a fantastic exemple of dynprog)

### Grading

For the ADK problem, we only require your code to pass Kattis.

If you decide to do any of the non-Kattis exercises from the Multiple Problems category, we require you to write tests to prove the validity of your code.
