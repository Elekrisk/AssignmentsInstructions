# DD1349 | Week 2

1) **Mr Tobbe, this is why we must use 'task', not 'week'.**

2) Yay! Pallindan, excluding any potential komplettering, is over!

We could force you through a prototying week, but MDI:n is already doing a good job of that. Instead, we trust that you already know the differences between high- and low-fidelity prototypes.

## Assignment
### Begin writing
"Where do I start?" - Question of the week.

Keep on reading to find more detailed descriptions of some of these steps!

1. Begin on your project. Divide the work by source code distinct partitions of _must-haves_.
2. Entertain a fashionable README file.

See week 0 and 1 for project expectations.

### Puzzle coding

> Once upon a time, there was two programmers collaborating on a project. They planned to write two features each, one dependent on the other. Both knew what the features should do. A weekend later they merge their respective work, but nothing runs. They had the what, but not the how.

Simply, if two structures are supposed to interact, deside the output and inputs of those structures. Learn to design your code before writing it. 

It could be as simple as telling a bud: "Hey, I need to call these functions and expect these outputs from these inputs."
